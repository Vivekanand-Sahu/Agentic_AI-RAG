If you do not throw doubles by your third turn, you must pay the $50 fine to get out of Jail and then move forward the number of spaces shown by your next throw.\n\nWhile in Jail, you can still engage in buying and selling properties, houses, and hotels, as well as collecting rents. \n\n(Source: Monopoly game rules provided in the context)", "sources": ["/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:4:1", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:4:2", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:4:0", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:2:2", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:5:0"], "document_uploaded": "", "cache_hit": false}
