Throwing doubles on any of your next three turns allows you to move forward the number of spaces shown by your doubles throw. However, even if you throw doubles, your turn ends, and you do not take another turn.  \n2. If you possess the \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card, you can use it to get out of jail. The card must then be returned to the bottom of the deck.  \n3. You may purchase the \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card from another player and then use it during your turn.  \n4. As a last resort, you can pay a fine of $50 before rolling the dice on either of your next two turns. If you do not throw doubles by your third turn, you must pay the $50 fine to get out of Jail and then move forward according to your throw afterwards.  \n\nEven while in Jail, you can still engage in buying and selling property, houses, and hotels, and collect rents (sources: text on \"JAIL\" and \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card).", "sources": ["/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:4:2", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:4:0", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:4:1", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:2:2", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:1:1"], "document_uploaded": "", "cache_hit": false}
