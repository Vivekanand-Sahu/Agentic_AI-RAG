However, even if you throw doubles, you do not take another turn after getting out (Source: context).\n\n2. **Using \"Get Out of Jail Free\" Card**: If you have a \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card, you can use it to get out of jail. After using it, return the card facedown to the bottom of the deck (Source: context).\n\n3. **Buying from Another Player**: If you don\u2019t have a \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card, you can purchase one from another player at an agreed price (Source: context).\n\n4. **Paying a Fine**: If you choose not to throw doubles, you can pay a fine of $50 before rolling the dice on either of your next two turns. If you do not throw doubles by your third turn, you must pay the $50 fine to get out, then immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by your throw (Source: context).\n\nEven while in jail, you can buy and sell properties, buy and sell houses and hotels, and collect rents (Source: context).", "sources": ["/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:4:2", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:4:0", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:4:1", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:2:2", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:1:1"], "document_uploaded": "", "cache_hit": false}
{"timestamp": "2025-05-26T01:27:54.067394", "question": "Check documents and tell me how to buy a property?", "answer": "To buy a property in the given context, follow these steps: \n\n1. **Direct Purchase**: If you land on a property that is available for sale, you may purchase it at the printed price. You pay the Bank this amount in cash and receive the Title Deed card for that property.\n\n2. **Auction Process**: If you choose not to buy the property at the printed price, it will be put up for auction by the Banker. All players can bid on the property, which starts at any amount. The highest bidder at the end of the auction pays the Bank the amount of their bid in cash and receives the Title Deed.\n\n3. **Buying Houses**: Once you own all properties in a color group, you can buy houses from the Bank and place them on your properties. Each house's price is indicated on the Title Deed card. Houses can only be added to unimproved properties first, and you can only build one house on any property at a time.\n\n4. **Mortgaging and Lifting Mortgages**: If the property is mortgaged, you can buy it, but must consider extra costs. You can lift the mortgage at once by paying the mortgage amount plus a 10% interest. If you choose not to lift the mortgage immediately, you will owe the Bank 10% interest when you buy the property and an additional 10% if you lift the mortgage later.\n\n5. **Complete Color Group Advantage**: Owning all properties in a color group (e.g., Boardwalk and Park Place) allows you to buy hotels after returning the four houses from one property and paying the hotel price as shown on the Title Deed card.\n\nThis structured approach allows you to navigate the property buying process effectively. \n\nReference: [Monopoly Rules Document](https://example-link-to-monopoly-rules.com) (exemplified URL for reference purposes).", "sources": ["/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:6:2", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:3:1", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:5:0", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:6:1", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:5:2"], "document_uploaded": "", "cache_hit": false}
{"timestamp": "2025-05-26T01:28:51.756535", "question": "What is an apple?", "answer": "No relevant documents were found in the database, so a web search was performed.\n\nAn apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp.), specifically the species Malus domestica, which is the most widely grown variant globally. Apples originated in Central Asia, where their wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, still grows today. They have been cultivated for thousands of years and have significant cultural relevance across various mythologies and religions, including Norse and Greek traditions as well as Christianity in Europe. Commercially, apples are propagated through clonal grafting due to the genetic variability seen when grown from seeds. There are over 7,500 cultivars of apples, each bred for different tastes and uses, such as eating raw, cooking, and cider production. \n\nIn terms of physical characteristics, apples can vary in size and color and typically contain five interior chambers (carpels) that hold seeds. They also have a protective skin that can be waxy and may appear russeted. Nutritionally, raw apples are high in water content and provide dietary fiber along with various vitamins and minerals. \n\nCulinarily, apples are versatile, consumed fresh, as juice, or used in a variety of dishes, from pies to sauces. They are also the basis for traditional food pairings and have been involved in various cultural practices, such as gifting apples during Chinese New Year to symbolize peace. However, apple seeds contain amygdalin, which can be toxic in large quantities, but insignificant amounts are harmless. Apples have also gained a reputation for their health benefits, often encapsulated in the proverb, \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away\" (Apple - Wikipedia).", "sources": [], "document_uploaded": "", "cache_hit": false}
