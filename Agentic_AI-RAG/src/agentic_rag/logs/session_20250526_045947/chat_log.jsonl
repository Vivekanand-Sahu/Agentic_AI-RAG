They are unique for their ability to achieve true and sustained flight, unlike any other mammals, and have forelimbs adapted into wings. The smallest bat is Kitti's hog-nosed bat, measuring just 29-34 mm in body length, while the largest is the giant golden-crowned flying fox, which can reach a weight of 1.6 kg and a wingspan of up to 1.7 m. Bats play a significant ecological role, with many species acting as pollinators and seed dispersers, particularly in tropical regions (Wikipedia). They comprise roughly 20% of all classified mammal species with over 1,400 species identified globally. Most bats are nocturnal and are known for using echolocation to navigate and hunt, especially for insects, some also consuming fruits, nectar, and even blood (Wikipedia). The scientific classification places them in the clade Scrotifera, with traditional divisions into megabats and microbats reflecting their diverse feeding habits and anatomical adaptations (Wikipedia).", "sources": [], "document_uploaded": "", "cache_hit": false}
