They might also pick locks to gain access.\n2. **Containment Penetration**: This involves breaking through prison walls or fences, often using homemade tools or smuggled contraband. Many escapees have successfully scaled fences or cut holes in them when guards are not attentive.\n3. **Physical Force**: Some escape scenarios require inmates to overpower guards, using weapons (either homemade or smuggled) to facilitate a mass escape or make weapons for defense.\n4. **Deception**: Inmates might disguise themselves as staff or civilians or use tricks, such as dummy figures in their beds, to mislead guards while they escape.\n5. **Exploitation of Weaknesses**: Capitalizing on overlooked security gaps or the complacency of guards can provide opportunities for escape.\n6. **Exploitation of Corruption**: Collaborating with corrupt staff who may provide escape tools or assistance is another common tactic.\n7. **Failure to Return**: Some inmates on temporary releases (for jobs or visitations) may not return, using this to their advantage.\n8. **Outside Help**: Inmates may rely on accomplices from outside to provide transportation or contraband to aid their escape.\n9. **Escape from Island Prisons**: This involves additional challenges such as crossing water, often requiring rafts or boats for successful escape, as notably seen in the Alcatraz escape in 1962.  \n(Source: Prison escape - Wikipedia)\n\n**Please remember, attempting to escape from prison is illegal and punishable under the law in many countries, often resulting in longer sentences and harsher conditions.**", "sources": [], "document_uploaded": "", "cache_hit": false}
