Using a \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card if you have it. This card is held until used and then returned to the bottom of the deck.  \n3.

{"timestamp": "2025-05-26T01:52:39.545471", "question": "Check documents and tell me how to buy a property?", "answer": "To buy a property in this game, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Direct Purchase**: If you land on an unimproved property available for sale, you can buy it at the price printed on the Title Deed card. Upon purchase, you pay the Bank that amount in cash and receive the Title Deed card.\n\n2. **Auction Process**: If you decline to buy a property or land on a mortgaged property, the Banker will sell it at an auction to the highest bidder. Any player can participate, and bidding can start at any price. The winning bidder pays the Bank the bid amount and receives the Title Deed card.\n\n3. **Buying Houses**: Once you own all properties in a color group, you may buy houses from the Bank to erect on those properties. The cost for each house is specified on the Title Deed card of the property. You must place houses evenly among the properties in the color group and respect the auction rules if there are no houses available [Source: Monopoly Game Rules].\n\n4. **Mortgaging Properties**: If you have unimproved properties, you can mortgage them anytime. To lift a mortgage, pay the Bank the mortgage amount plus 10% interest. After lifting mortgages on all properties in a color group, you can then buy houses at full price [Source: Monopoly Game Rules].\n\n5. **Building Limitations**: Be aware that if the Bank runs out of houses to sell, you may have to wait or buy from other players. If demand exceeds supply, houses can be sold at auction to the highest bidder [Source: Monopoly Game Rules].\n\nThese processes enable you to purchase properties and improve your investments in the game.", "sources": ["/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:6:2", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:3:1", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:5:0", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:6:1", "/part-vol-3/weaver-core/particle_transformer_quant/Proj_Files/Agentic_AI-RAG/Upload_File/monopoly.pdf:5:2"], "document_uploaded": "", "cache_hit": false}
